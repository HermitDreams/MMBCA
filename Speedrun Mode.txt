speedrun mode???
- timer
 - present in-battle
 - on the pause menu
 - at boot-up when a speedrun game is saved/active
 - briefly during important cutscenes like a split
 - toggles between IGT (only ticks while in control) and RTA (counts time since file was started)
  - tracks both regardless of which you have visible, and shows other at end of game
- RNG removed; predetermined results mimicking FF1
 - amount of steps between each encounter, flipped at end
 - virus battles, including their battlefields, are predetermined per area
 - Mystery Data rewards cycle through list (types: individual standing, 1-in-battle, 2-in-battle, etc)
 - Deck paths are predetermined (list of 32 paths, each pulled 4 times?)
 - VarSwrd has set order (list of 16, only guarantee at least 1 of each outcome?)
 - Dodge, Slot-In, and UV rolls are same values for a list of 256, plugged into normal formula
 - Random movements become a set seemingly erratic pattern per enemy
 - Soft resets maintain list positions, hard resets don't
