# MMBCA
A public repository for databases associated with MMBCA (name pending changes).

MMBCA intends to provide a foundation of enemy, attack, and area stats (to name a few) for use across multiple genres, including Tabletop, RPG, Strategy, and Shmup.
It is effectively a fangame that mixes Battle Network, Boktai, and Meteos aspects together to create a new world and a marriage of various core mechanics.

This idea was started in 2004 and has undergone lots of thought and changes since my teens. There might still be GeoCities pages of its original edition floating around!

## Battle Script Usage
To use the `/battle` mIRC script, create a `p1.txt` and `p2.txt` in mIRC's appdata folder, then populate those with the chips you wish to battle with. To do this automatically, ensure `/chip`'s directories match where you placed `Chip List (Abridged)` and that `/bnctbet` is able to run.
