GODFIELD STYLE

= Game Rules =

- Support 9 players
- Each player starts with 400 + (100 x Amount of Opponents) Max HP, 10 MB, and a plain 30 Damage Navi ATtack (NormNav1)
- Each player has 9 panels they can stand on (3x3) and starts in middle
- Sunlight rules apply wholesale (Gauge is now consumable MB capping at 100)
- Each player draws 11 chips (9 regular, 2 wild) at start of battle (rarity table below)
- Cards are replaced when Deleted or Added
- Turn order based on Navi Speed + Chip Speed
- Each player selects 3 chips and a target at beginning of round
- Each chip costs 10% of its normal MB Size to use
- You can shuffle all 3 chips for new ones if you can't afford the full cost
- You can interrupt a turn by sacrificing a wild chip for 10x its MB cost
- Navi Attack is used at end of turn
- You may move one panel at end of round (Dodge penalties still apply for staying still)
- The last player without 0 HP remaining is the winner
- A limit of rounds can be set with a rule of "Stalemate" or "Bugs"
- "Stalemate" will determine the winner based on who has the most HP remaining
- "Bugs" will continue to play with random effects happening at the beginning of each round

3: 20%
4: 15%
N: 10%
5:  5%

= Mechanic Changes =

- Amount of Splashed Targets will be added to most spreading attacks
  * Maybe Splash AoE picks a random other field to hit if it spills out of a boundary?
- Meteors select random targets
- Confusion is Random Movement
- NaviChips change your Max HP, Element, and Attack 
- NaviChips will be either consumed or shuffled upon picking them up

+ Battlefields +

- All players on one Team share the same field, and are thus more susceptible to being splashed
- If an attack tries to hit a panel outside of a field, somebody else's field will be arbitrarily placed adjacent to it for that attack
  * i.e. Target is at 2-B3 and Player 3 is at 3-B1
  * Target is hit with WideSwrd, which tries to reach to 2-B4 (doesn't exist)
  * Player 3's field is chosen to be adjacent to the south
  * 2-B4 becomes 3-B1
  * Player 3 is hit with WideSwrd too
- If there are only 2 occupied fields, they are placed side-by-side at a randomly decided edge until a Virus generates a new field

= Bugged Play =

- During Bugged Play, one of a series of affects will occur to each player at the beginning of a round
- Additionally, a Virus will be spawned every (20% of Round Timer Setting) rounds
- Each Virus group is given their own 3x3 field
- Virus generation follows standard RPG methods
- Viruses target by weighing everybody's remaining HP as the chance to be targeted
