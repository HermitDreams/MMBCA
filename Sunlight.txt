SUNLIGHT GENERATION

There are 8 bars of sunlight on a Solar Gauge.
The Solar Gauge is placed at the top of the screen, where the Custom Gauge goes in Battle Network.
The Solar Level goes between 64 to 192 points. After that, it counts up to 256.
Every 16 points after 64 is a Bar.
Areas have a Base Sunlight attached to them (usual is 64, UnderNet is 16).
Alter this per battle by rolling 4d32 and adding the result to the total Solar Level.
