- Biographies -

= Darnell =
A scarecrow-based NetNavi from the outskirts of Kotobuki, designed by her operator to maximize crop health. She is well-versed in virus battle operations, despite playing a more supportive role, as her whole farm is synced up to Unix Standard Time. She is inviting and flirty, but nobody is allowed to touch the straw hat.

[Operator To-Be-Named]
Her operator is skilled in repairs and tinkering, but not oft seen outside the farmhouse. As such, she burns easily and wears a hat that matches her NetNavi. She is well-mannered and sometimes taken aback by how outgoing Darnell is.

= Aquilon =
A mackerel-based NetNavi that has sworn himself to the guidance of the fresh ocean breeze. He believes that listening to the wind will lead you to your heart's desires and purpose. He is quite serious and confident but always speaks softly.

[Operator To-Be-Named]
His operator was a former naval navigator and now a sailor by hobby. He took to the seas and left Aquilon behind, knowing the winds would bring them back together when they've become wiser and better travelled.

= Silent =
A dark-oak ent-based NetNavi, belonging to a ranger that sees over protected wildlife. He only speaks when spoken to, and will stand guard, literally, to keep poachers away from sensitive virus banks. He is next in line to look after The Quarantine, should tragedy befall the current curators.

[Operator To-Be-Named]
A middleage woman recruited by Yoku Zoo to protect plants and animals that are not yet ready to be coveted by the world. She has a home in the southern reaches of Kingscape that she rarely gets to visit, but still appreciates the wildlife that gets to roam free in the city without fear.

= Skyfall =
An unoperated Navi that was once a human living in an apartment neighbouring ground zero of the Kotobuki Incident. She had succumb to too much radiation to come back to physical space and still survive. Following guidance from Colonel's teachings, she has learned to master her own essence to protect this world in a way she couldn't protect her home.

= Glory =
A shiny NetNavi who serves no purpose other than to be the center of attention. His creator designed him out of boredom and then let him loose on the web. Wherever there are problems, he will be there to make them worse. Officials are offering a reward to whoever can convince his operator to jack him out.

= Vampere =
Not quite a Navi at all, but rather an Immortal hailing from an underworld cathedral. The screams of anguish echoing through her crystalline walls have beckoned her to play a rallying concert for those that wish to make noise.

= IlluMan =
A shapeshifting spirit of the sun, taking the form of a NetNavi just to be more easily perceived. The true nature of the Cyberworld's potholes has intrigued faer to play along until Lunacy takes over.

= Riverie =
A cloaked captain that surfs the web cleaning up dead links at the behest of their operator. They will happily guide headstrong Navis to their inevitable destinations. Their operator lives in isolation and manages cloud services, supposedly somewhere in Nettopia.

= RootMan =
A fungal Navi that leaves copies of himself scattered around and seeks to infect all devices. His operator is a mould inspector that helps him reach devices not yet connected to the internet. He hopes to control the new unstable virus spreading around.

= Flaribel =
The neighbour two doors down from Skyfall. A blazing passion within her has become completely directed toward giving Navis a second lease on life, and transformed her into the essence of fire. She yearns to burn down the oubliette of Cyberspace and return home.

= AnonyMan =
A NetNavi built purely from static, intended to be hard to identify but relatable to all. A diplomat that held no power in everyday life, but has become a leader among the UnderNet denizens.

[Operator To-Be-Named]
A rejected Official, he has decided to make and enforce his own laws with the help of his NetNavi's electric cuffs and swift shocks. One day, he will embrace and synchronize with his NetNavi, and no one will be able to deny his authority. No one quite knows how he gathered such a following and budget...


==============

Darnell, Vampere, IlluMan: Adversaries? Darnell complaining about them trying to harvest souls, "The only one doin' any harvestin' 'round here is me! Now git! Fly back to your own netpage!"

Aquilon & Riverie: The winds of Promise and Inevitability. Riverie condescending Aquilon, "Oh, my young minnow. You still insist on following the jetstream, unaware you're fighting the rapids."

Silent & RootMan: Fighting over territory. Silent seeks to end RootMan's ruckus and insists on laying low, "This is not the way plants were meant to rule." "Fungi aren't bound to rules! We'll take control of everywhere!"

Skyfall & Flaribel: Lost intertwined fates. Flaribel insists everything will be better once they're home, "Dance with me, Sarah! We'll burn this prison down and make a better world for everyone!" "This isn't the way, Kayla! This is our home now, and we have to protect it!"

Glory & AnonyMan: Ends of the food chain? Glory proves to be a wonderful asset to elevate Anony to power, "however, at this stage, there can be no problems. Arresting you will be my first peacekeeping duty!"
