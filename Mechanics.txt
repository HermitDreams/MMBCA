BATTLE MECHANICS

When generating a virus battle, try to place player in center of their field.
If the center panel has a penalty (Sand, Swamp, etc), select a random viable panel.
If no panels are viable, place them in center anyway and reroll panel type until viable.
Viruses get placed onto random panels in their field they can occupy.

The start of a turn will select all three chips in a branching pattern for all entities with a Deck.
Before a chip activates, the entity can commit any available movement.
By default, the player moves one tile in a cardinal direction per chip they select.
If an entity spends the whole turn not moving, a -1 Dodge penalty is accrued.

Accuracy and Dodge each roll d32 against each other, and the grade adds a Grade*4 bonus to their rolls.
Penalties to Dodge and Acc are applied as a modifier after the roll. e.g., -2 Dodge will roll d32, add bonus, then subtract 8 from total.
* The Blind debuff sets Acc to Grade E.

The Custom Gauge will charge by 5+(d4*Bars) per chip column, before any action is taken.
The "Shrouded" debuff sets the Sunlight Bonus to a flat 0.
Slot-Ins have a Gauge% chance to succeed. An attempt, successful or not, will delete the chip but let defenses inherit its HP anyway.
At 50% or higher, the selected branch can be rerolled at the cost of fully draining the gauge.
A reroll can only be done once per turn, in the event a bonus prevents gauge from draining below 50%.
