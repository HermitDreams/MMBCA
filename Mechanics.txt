BATTLE MECHANICS

When generating a virus battle, try to place player in center of their field.
If the center panel has a penalty (Sand, Swamp, etc), select a random viable panel.
If no panels are viable, place them in center anyway and reroll panel type until viable.
Viruses get placed onto random panels in their field they can occupy.

Accuracy & Dodge
- Accuracy typically between 50 to 200, Dodge between 40 to 110
- Dodge rolls a random number between 1 and target's score. If it matches or exceed the attacker's Accuracy score, the attack misses.
- Dodge is reduced by 10 for each stolen panel
- Accuracy is cut in half when Blind (does not apply to Meteo)
- Meteors flip a coin per hit to see if each lands, instead of rolling Accuracy
- Melee gains a +20 Accuracy buff if the attacker is already in position to hit
- Standing in the backrow decreases Melee Accuracy by -5 (-10 if both attacker and target are in backrow)
- Indirect damage (panels that are not intended targets) suffer a -20 Accuracy penalty (i.e. the splash on Shotgun is 92 Acc)

The start of a turn will select all three chips in a branching pattern for all entities with a Deck.
Before a chip activates, the entity can commit any available movement.
By default, the player moves one tile in a cardinal direction per chip they select.
If an entity spends the whole turn not moving, a -20 Dodge penalty is applied until next movement.



The Custom Gauge will charge by 5+(d4*Bars) per chip column, before any action is taken.
The "Shrouded" debuff sets the Sunlight Bonus to a flat 0.
Slot-Ins have a Gauge% chance to succeed. An attempt, successful or not, will delete the chip. Defenses inherit a successful Slot-In's Max HP.
At 50% or higher, the selected branch can be rerolled at the cost of fully draining the gauge.
A reroll can only be done once per turn, in the event a bonus prevents gauge from draining below 50%.


MAYBES

- Obstacles protect your deck from chip damage, at cost of being bypassed by certain attack methods?
 - Prevents situation where a Sword would attack your Obstacle and deal chip damage to your own deck
- Sparker changed to a Barrier? (HP will be reduced)
